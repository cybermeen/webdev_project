Web-Based Application Development Project Workflows

This web application is designed to be a personal, daily-use platform that combines productivity with creativity. It allows users to manage tasks in a light, gamified way while also offering a space to capture moments from their day through a digital scrapbook-style log. Rather than focusing strictly on productivity or mindfulness, the application aims to create a positive and enjoyable experience that users are motivated to return to daily. Through features such as task tracking, visual progress feedback, and customizable daily logs, the application supports organization, reflection, and self-expression within a single cohesive web-based system.
